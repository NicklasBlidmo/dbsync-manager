## Unreleased

- Add wizard, step 2: the schema-name table is fetched with POST. As a
  GET the whole form rode in the query string, and with 18 GeoPackages
  it passed gunicorn's request-line limit, so the table never refreshed.

## v1.0.0 (2026-09-28)

First release. Ten slices (design §14): registry and credentials,
supervisor, consistency check and health, add wizard, hooks and alerts,
remove and re-init as operations, log history, UI foundation, visual
pass, functional polish; plus the release-readiness pass that made the
repository generic. In production at the author's organisation since
2026-09-25. See `docs/review-notes/` for the field history behind the
invariants in `CLAUDE.md`.
